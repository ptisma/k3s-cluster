### kube-prometheus-stack
Installs the kube-prometheus stack, a collection of Kubernetes manifests, Grafana dashboards, and Prometheus rules combined with documentation and scripts to provide easy to operate end-to-end Kubernetes cluster monitoring with Prometheus using the Prometheus Operator.

By default it will also install the following charts: grafana, prometheus-node-exporter, kube-state-metrics.

Prometheus: collects metrics from configured targets at given intervals, evaluates rule expressions, displays results, and can trigger alerts if certain conditions arise
Components:
- Prometheus Server: core component that scrapes and stores time series data (works on pull mechanism)
- Exporters: expose metrics on behalf of other applications or services
- Service Discovery: automatically discover targets to scrape metrics from
- Pushgateway: allow short-lived jobs to expose their metrics to Prometheus. (push mechanism for non pull sources)
- Alertmanager: handle alerts generated by the Prometheus server

Grafana: queries the Prometheus, provides dashboards for visualization

Prometheus-Operator: k8 operator which simplifies the deployment and management of Prometheus instances in Kubernetes

prometheus-node-exporter: exporter for hardware and OS metrics exposed by *NIX kernels

kube-state-metrics: exporter for k8,  service that listens to the Kubernetes API server and generates metrics about the state of the objects

### Install
Using helm:
helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update
